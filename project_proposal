If not, what is you planned algorithm
If yes, what is the performance
However, this report  is open ended (just like the proposal) and you can present your current progress in your own proffered way 

You just need to submit a pdf file with your progress, you do not need to submit any code now. You will submit the code for this at the very end.

Only one person of the full group needs to submit this report.
